![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on customer churn analysis for a gas and electricity utility provider. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to client churn and develop a strategic investigative framework. By leveraging Python (Pandas and NumPy) for data analysis and visualization techniques for trend interpretation, the project aims to engineer and optimize a Random Forest model to enhance churn prediction accuracy, with a target of achieving 85%. The findings are summarized in an executive report for the Associate Director, providing actionable insights to support decision-making.
